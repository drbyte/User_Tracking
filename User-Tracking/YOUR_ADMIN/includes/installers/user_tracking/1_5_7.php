/**
 *
 * Version 1.5.7:
 * - Correct the condition of an admin mydebug log being generated when the selection is made to display
 *     filtered entries to hide entries that accessed an item on the list of filtered URIs.
 * - Added guidance in the instructions to support continued operation of this plugin with ZC 1.5.1 because of
 *     an issue that existed in the table handling code of that version corrected in ZC 1.5.2 and above. See
 *     https://github.com/zencart/zencart/commit/f891d240fe199af7510a9a4ae72024f66dd1f33c for solution.
 * - Update the uninstall SQL to prevent removing configuration keys that might have a configuration_group_id of zero.
